[2024-03-25-12:43:48] stft+early+late did not work out well, trying another combination of alphas. emb loss helped a bit, trying it with stft loss only 
[2024-03-27-13:39:35] early/late reflections did not help - testing only late reflections regularizer and also additional logmel loss which from roc curves appears to be the most sensitive to reverb
